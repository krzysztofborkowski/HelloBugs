OVERVIEW:
Below are few bugs we detected on AndroidTV devices.
All of them were visible on MiBox and none on FireTV.

BUG1:
Observed behavior:
  Sometimes, activating a text edit field results in text (single character) being inserted into the field.

Steps to reproduce:
  - build, install, launch the app (this can be code by calling `./build_and_run`)
  - press Down once (to focus the text field)
  - press Select to activate the text field
  - repeat until bug is visible
    - input few letters
    - press Back to minimize the keyboard
    - press Select to activate the text field

Expected behavior:
  Activating a text field shouldn't affect field's text


BUG2:
Observed behavior:
  Pressing right-arrow key on virtual keyboard when cursor is at the end of text results in keyboard being switched
  to password-specific keyboard

Steps to reproduce:
  - build, install, launch the app (this can be code by calling `./build_and_run`)
  - press Down once (to focus the text field)
  - press Select to activate the text field
  - select the right-arrow key on virtual keyboard (near right-bottom corner)

Expected behavior:
  Pressing right-arrow key on virtual keyboard while the cursor is at the end of the text should do nothing

Additional notes:
  At first it may seem like the keyboard that pops up after pressing the arrow key is just a standard "expanded"
  keyboard, but when inputting some text in non-youi application (ex. when logging to google account on the device)
  we can see that this keyboard is shown only for password-fields and pressing virtual right-arrow on non-password
  field does nothing
